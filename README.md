### What is it?

- It's an application to have Q&A related to events
- Thus, a user can create an event. Get a copy-able link to the event!
- On the events-page people can ask a question and receive replies, just like in twitter/reddit!

### How to run?

- Clone the repo (Also leave a star ðŸ˜Š)
- Run `pnpm install` if you don't have pnpm <a href="https://pnpm.io/installation">install here</a>
- Copy the example .env by `cp .env.example .env`
- Add a POSTGRESDB link in the database URL
- After installation run `pnpm dev` to start a development server
- There you have it!ðŸš€

### What's coming up?

- [x] API tests
- [x] Bug fixed about event-creation
